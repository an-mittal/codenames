# KodeNames
A popular word game.

# Fork Changes

- Original codenames wordset, thanks to [@eliotfowler](https://github.com/eliotfowler)
- No analytics or tracking
- Removed translations.
- Faster loading, slimmer code
- Added a "*cast*" feature, which hides the seed and other controls so you can stream the game easily.
- Picks up the seed from URL.

# How to play over the internet?

1. Go to <https://captnemo.in/codenames/>
2. Click the cast button. Instructions will be copied to your clipboard. This will give you a random numeric seed. You can use a different one as well if you'd like.
3. Send the instructions on a Private chat to the Spymasters. This gets them the URL with the seed and asks them to click the Spymaster button.
4. Cast your browser tab and get on a call with all your players. I've tried this over Zoom, but other platforms should also work.

For the next game:

1. Pause your screen share.
2. Refresh your page.
3. Click cast again.
4. Send instructions to the 2 new spymasters.
